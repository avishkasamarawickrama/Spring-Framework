# Spring Framework Project

This project demonstrates the core concepts of the **Spring Framework**, including Spring Core, configuration, runtime value injection, environment management, and bean lifecycle. It is designed to help students and developers understand how to build and configure Spring applications effectively.

---

## **Features**
- **Spring Core**: Demonstrates dependency injection and inversion of control.
- **Configuration**: Shows how to configure Spring using XML, Java-based configuration, and annotations.
- **Full vs Lightweight Mode**: Explains the differences between full and lightweight container modes.
- **Runtime Value Injection**: Injects values at runtime using properties files, environment variables, and `@Value` annotations.
- **Environment Configuration**: Manages different environments (e.g., dev, prod) using Spring profiles.
- **Bean Lifecycle**: Demonstrates bean initialization and destruction callbacks.

---

## **Modules**
1. **Spring Core**: Basics of dependency injection and inversion of control.
2. **Configuration**: XML, Java-based, and annotation-based configuration.
3. **Runtime Value Injection**: Injecting values dynamically.
4. **Environment Configuration**: Using profiles for different environments.
5. **Bean Lifecycle**: Managing bean lifecycle callbacks.
